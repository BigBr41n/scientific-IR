 
Malware, short for "malicious software," refers to any software intentionally designed to cause harm to a computer system, network, or device. It encompasses a wide variety of harmful programs, including viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. Malware can disrupt operations, steal sensitive information, or damage data and systems.

One of the most common types of malware is a virus, which attaches itself to legitimate programs and spreads to other files and systems. Worms, another type of malware, self-replicate and spread across networks without needing a host program. Trojans often masquerade as legitimate software to trick users into installing them, giving attackers unauthorized access to the victimâ€™s system.

Ransomware is a particularly malicious form of malware that encrypts the victim's files and demands a ransom for decryption. Spyware secretly monitors user activity, often for the purpose of stealing personal information like login credentials or financial details. Adware, while not always malicious, can display unwanted ads and may slow down system performance.

Malware can be spread through infected email attachments, malicious websites, or compromised software downloads. Effective protection against malware requires a combination of up-to-date antivirus software, secure browsing practices, and awareness of phishing attacks. Regular system updates and strong password management also play a key role in preventing malware infections.
