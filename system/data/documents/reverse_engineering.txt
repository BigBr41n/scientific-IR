Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing and deconstructing software, hardware, or systems to understand their inner workings, often with the intent of replicating or modifying them. In the context of software, reverse engineering typically involves examining compiled code (like executables or libraries) to understand how a program operates, its structure, or how it interacts with the system.
