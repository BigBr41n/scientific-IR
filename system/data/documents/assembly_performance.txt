 
Assembly language is often used for optimizing performance and memory usage in scenarios where resources are limited, such as embedded systems or applications that run on low-power devices. Unlike higher-level programming languages, which provide abstractions that simplify programming but can introduce inefficiencies, assembly gives developers the ability to write code that directly interacts with the hardware. This allows them to make precise optimizations, such as using fewer instructions, reducing memory usage, or controlling how data is stored in memory. Assembly’s efficiency is particularly valuable when dealing with time-critical applications, where even small delays in processing can lead to significant issues. For example, in a real-time control system, every millisecond counts, and assembly allows developers to fine-tune how the CPU processes tasks. Additionally, because assembly provides direct control over the system’s memory, it’s possible to minimize memory overhead, which is essential for systems with limited RAM or storage. However, the trade-off is that assembly is much more difficult to learn and use compared to higher-level languages, and writing code in assembly requires in-depth knowledge of the underlying hardware and system architecture.
