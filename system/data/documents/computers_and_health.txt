 
The integration of computers and technology into the healthcare sector has transformed the way we diagnose, treat, and manage diseases. From the development of advanced medical devices to the analysis of vast amounts of health data, computers are playing a pivotal role in improving the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare systems worldwide. These advancements are not only enhancing patient care but are also enabling new methods of medical research and treatment.

One of the key areas where computers have made a significant impact is in medical imaging. Technologies like MRI, CT scans, and X-rays rely heavily on computer algorithms to produce high-quality images that help doctors diagnose conditions like tumors, fractures, and internal organ issues. These imaging techniques have become more precise and accessible, allowing for earlier detection of diseases and improved patient outcomes.
