Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, correlations, anomalies, and useful information from large datasets using statistical, mathematical, and computational techniques. It involves extracting hidden, previously unknown information and turning it into actionable knowledge. This field blends techniques from machine learning, statistics, database systems, and artificial intelligence to analyze massive datasets and identify trends or patterns that would be difficult for humans to detect.
